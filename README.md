For the unit 6 programming assignment, we will experiment with animation by creating two sphere geometries. 
The larger sphere will represent the earth and a smaller one will represent the moon similar to what is shown in the following figure.
To complete this assignment, include the following:
Make the larger sphere look like the earth by applying the following texture to it: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg/300px-The_Earth_seen_from_Apollo_17.jpg
Make the smaller sphere look like the moon by applying the following texture to it: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e1/FullMoon2010.jpg/280px-FullMoon2010.jpg

You must animate the scene but you do not need to allow the user to change the scene using mouse controls.
The scene must be animated as follows: 
The earth should rotate slowly. 
Place a light source to the right of the planet to only expose one side of the earth to lighting. This will simulate the effect of day and night on the planet’s surface.
The moon must rotate on its own axis as it rotates around the earth. 
Your moon should be relatively close to the earth so that the amount of clipping will be minimized.
Your moon’s orbit should be designed in such a way that at least a portion of the moon should come between the earth and the light source that is positioned to the right of the earth. This should simulate the effect of an eclipse.
The model does not need to be to scale. 
Grading Criteria:
Does the assignment include a sphere geometry textured as the earth? (Yes/No)
Does the assignment include a sphere geometry textured as the moon? (Yes/No)
Does the assignment include a light source to the right of the viewport that illuminates the earth and moon as the sun would? (Yes/No)
Does the earth rotate on its axis? (Yes/No)
Does the moon rotate on its axis? (yes/no)
Does the moon rotate in an orbit around the earth? (Yes/No)
Was the JavaScript / Three.js code well documented (Scale of 1-4 where 1 is no comments and 4 is comprehensive comments)
